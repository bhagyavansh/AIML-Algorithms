# 📘 AI & ML Algorithms 
This repository contains my implementations of fundamental **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning algorithms** and **Python exercises**  from my 3rd semester of B.Tech CSE (AI/ML specialization).

Each file demonstrates a core concept in **Data Science, AI, or ML** – from regression models to graph/tree traversal and pathfinding.
